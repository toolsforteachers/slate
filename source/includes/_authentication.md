Tools for Teachers uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can request a new API key by email [admin@toolsforteachers.org.uk](admin@toolsforteachers.org.uk).

Tools for Teachers expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: your-api-key`

You must replace <code>your-api-key</code> with your personal API key.
